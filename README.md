# Match-Pose-A-system-for-learning-Yoga-and-Dance-poses-using-Pose-Estimation-Posenet-Tensorflow
Our system allows the user to choose the desired pose they want to imitate from the given image gallery. Once the yoga pose is selected, the user has to imitate the same pose in front of the webcam. Our system will prompt the user if they successfully imitate the pose. This helps the user to learn new poses accurately. We have used posenet model of tensorflow.js to get pose estimations of the user. We use multi pose algorithm for obtaining 17 key points from the webcam feed at real-time, which will track the real-time pose of the user. To give immediate feedback to user we display these extracted 17 key points along with constructed skeleton on the webcam feed. On the other hand, we run single pose estimation algorithm on the image selected from gallery.  The next step includes running a self-designed comparison algorithm on both of these poses to compare and find if userâ€™s pose matches the desired pose. To help user understand the process of imitation we also prompt the target angle between the joints required to match the pose on the right side of the screen to help them achieve the desired pose.
